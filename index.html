  STEP 1: index.html - The Starting Point
  ============================================================================
  
  This is a regular HTML file - the entry point of our React app.
  
  KEY CONCEPTS:
  - The <div id="root"></div> is an EMPTY container
  - This is where React will "mount" (put) our entire app
  - React doesn't replace the whole HTML page - it takes control of ONE element
  - Think of #root as a parking spot where React will "park" our app
  
  HOW IT WORKS:
  1. Browser loads this HTML file
  2. Browser finds the empty <div id="root">
  3. Browser loads the script from /src/main.jsx
  4. main.jsx tells React to put the App component inside #root
  5. React takes over and manages everything inside #root

    <!-- 
      This empty div is where React will render our entire app.
      React will find this element and put all our components inside it.
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>

    <!-- 
      This script tag loads our React code.
      type="module" means we're using ES6 modules (import/export).
      When the browser loads this, it will execute main.jsx
    -->
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
